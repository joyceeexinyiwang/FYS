(reframing)

- Identify and articulate the problem
    - Research on history
    - Draft report on hypotheses (why are students interested or not interested? why is it hard to pursue interdisciplinary experiences? why do academic silos exist? who can help?)
    - Pull together a team
     Focus groups
- Solve the problem
    - 10min joint-talks
    - Process-based hackathons = short simulations of interdisciplinary collaboration (and measurement of success)
    - discussions on specific interdisciplinary problems
        - provide information before the deliberation process
        - environmental issues

**Thesis**

> Interdisciplinarity: very much research and course offerings. A certain degree in pedagogies among a subset of professors.

> What hinders interdisciplinarity and produces academic silos is systematic and institutional constraints (e.g., graduation requirements, fundings) the pragmatism (CMU started as a vocational school and professional prep is still the priority of many students)
