# Fifth Year Scholar Porject
Research and experiments for the community project -- an adisciplinary idea fest -- as part of Joyce Wang's Fifth Year Scholarship (2018-2019) sponsored by Carnegie Mellon University.

## Concept
The concept of this event is rooted in the belief that our campus can be stronger if we step out of our academic silos,
and learn to understand how each other thinks.

It is for the entire Carnegie Mellon campus — undergraduate student, graduate students, faculty and staff. It asks participants from distinct disciplines to form groups of 2, and create something new that draws from their knowledge and experience. 

Participants can make anything creative: 
- video, essay, apps, website, performance, zine, poetry, demo, etc…

The environment should feel:
- collaborative, supportive, diverse, refreshing, and stress-free

The key values for this event are:
- **process** over result
- **posing questions** over finding solutions
- **collaboration** over competition
- **expression** over application
- **detail** over scale

The goal is to facilitate non-disciplinary and intersectional dialogues, and help people understand each other’s mindset and practice. I want to cater to CMU students' and faculty’s strong scholarly and creative interests, and provide tangible opportunities to challenge barriers that exist in and beyond the academic disciplines.
