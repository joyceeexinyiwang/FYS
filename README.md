# Fifth Year Scholar Porject
Research and experiments for the community project -- an adisciplinary idea fest -- as part of Joyce Wang's Fifth Year Scholarship (2018-2019) sponsored by Carnegie Mellon University.

## Concept
The concept of this event is rooted in the belief that our campus can be stronger if we step out of our academic silos,
and learn to understand how each other thinks.

It is for the entire Carnegie Mellon campus — undergraduate student, graduate students, faculty and staff. It asks participants from distinct disciplines to form groups of 2, and create something new that draws from their knowledge and experience. 

Participants can make anything creative: 
- video, essay, apps, website, performance, zine, poetry, demo, etc…

The environment should feel:
- collaborative, supportive, diverse, refreshing, and stress-free

The key values for this event are:
- **process** over result
- **posing questions** over finding solutions
- **collaboration** over competition
- **expression** over application
- **detail** over scale

The goal is to facilitate non-disciplinary and intersectional dialogues, and help people understand each other’s mindset and practice. I want to cater to CMU students' and faculty’s strong scholarly and creative interests, and provide tangible opportunities to challenge barriers that exist in and beyond the academic disciplines.

## Incentives
At Carnegie Mellon, I admire how academically and professional driven people are, yet I also notice the existence of academic silos. Social groups often form based on which major students are in. Many students rarely realize the resources in other colleges, or develop relationships with faculty and staff. The separation of academic programs also often leads to biases between majors. 

As a BXA student, I have benefited tremendously from my interdisciplinary education, and I believe the exploration across academic fields could be a valuable experience for everyone. In my opinion, interdisciplinary collaboration inspires knowledge, courage, and empathy. It invites closer attention to the different ways people think. The skills and understanding gained through interdisciplinary collaboration can also benefit dialogues that challenge barriers outside the academic realm. By providing a foundation of trust and a common vocabulary, the crossing of disciplines can serve as the first step towards more nuanced conversations that address social and political differences. 

With rich academic resources and an existing commitment to interdisciplinarity and diversity, Carnegie Mellon has a wonderful foundation for an event like the Non-Disciplinary Festival. There are many interdisciplinary spaces on campus such as BXA, IDeAte, the SHS program, ETC, STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, and Center for the Arts in Society. There are also grants dedicated to this cause such as SURG/CW, ProSEED, and CS+X [DRAMA]. Upon this foundation, I envision my project as an attempt to decentralize the institutional effort to bring together different talents, by providing an open, informal, festival-like platform to celebrate unconventional, exploratory teamwork. 

## Inspirations
#### [Antidisciplinarathon](http://hypotext.co/antidisciplinarathon)
In the summer of 2017, Katherine Ye, a current PhD student at CMU organized an event called “Antidisciplinarathon” in the Bay Area. She invited professionals in many different fields to make creative projects, and the products of their collaborations were wonderfully diverse, innovative, and thought-provoking. I was extremely inspired by this alternative form of “hackathon” which emphasized dialogues and thinking process. My project, the Non-Disciplinary Festival, is an adaptation of Antidisciplinarathon, but it is different in that it welcomes everyone to participate, not just those with expertise. I believe everyone is an expert of their own experience and that everyone has something to express. 
Katherine has personally approved my adaptation of her idea and agreed to provide guidance and support with resources in her graduate student network.

#### Edinburgh Festival Fringe
The Edinburgh Festival Fringe is a performance art festival that supports adventurous and exploratory artists. It encourages the crossover of mediums and contents, and gathers talents from all over the world. Learning from this festival, I envision my project to also be a celebration of diversity, creativity, and removal of boundaries. 
In fact, Pittsburgh has its own version of Fringe Festival, which I plan to attend in April.

#### Stever Open-Mic
In high school, I often went to this restaurant called Al Taller for open mic events. It was a very instrumental experience to my teenage years. After coming to CMU, I missed it a lot, so I organized an open-mic night in Stever with my house fellow Ashley Grice in the fall semester of my freshman year. We had students performing spoken words, rap, storytelling, music, etc. It was a super fun experience for me seeing the wonderful and often surprising talent of my peers. It was also my first time organizing an event at CMU. With my Fifth Year Scholar project, I hope I can bring people together again.
