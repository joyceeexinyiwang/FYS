## Approach (as if 1/31/2019)

- **Assessment**
  - Students
    - Undergraduate students who are currently in an interdisciplinary program or double majors: how they found this program, the support they have received in their studies, the support they wished they have received.
    - Undergraduate students who are not in an interdisciplinary program or double majors: curiosity and interests towards interdisciplinary studies,  the support they've received towards interdisciplinary studies.
  - Faculty
    - How they view the value of interdisciplinary studies
    - Perception of students interests towards interdisciplinary studies
    - Whether they have provided support for interested students 
    - The resources they have received to facilitate interdisciplinary research and teaching
  - Staff (advisors)
    - How they view the value of interdisciplinary studies
    - Perception of students interests towards interdisciplinary studies
    - Whether they have provided support for interested students
    - The resources they have received to facilitate interdisciplinary experiences for students
- **Analysis of resource gaps**
  - Want
    - whether students and faculty are interested in pursuing or facilitating interdisciplinary undergraduate studies, and why (referring to the history of the institution)
  - Needs
    - what students need to explore beyond their programs
    - what advisors and faculty need to facilitate interdisciplinary studies
  - Resources
    - what existing resources are there to support students, faculty, and staff
- **Creation of asset map**
  - network of funding and mentorship structures
- **Workshops, events, and student organization**
